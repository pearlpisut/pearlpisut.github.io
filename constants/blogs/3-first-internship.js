    <br><br>
    Just finished my second year of uni, I was hungry for the internship experience. I only had much to learn
    and so muh competitions for roles, so I was reaching out to various start-ups I knew from career fairs.
    Long story short, I completed a <a class="link" href='https://github.com/pearlpisut/pantheon-lab-solution'>programming assignment</a>,
    received, and accepted an offer at Pantheon Lab at HKSTP - just walkable from my uni. I was super pumped and would soon be a
    full-stack developer intern - my FIRST _real job_.
    <section>the beginner's struggle</section>
    It's a young start-up of around 20 employees, working to deliver software solutions with its unique digital AI-human; for
    example, Kiosk order machine in KFC and info center at airports. I sat in one of the corner, a monitor on
    my table, shy and clueless. It started off with me trying to set up their backend systems in
    Docker. It's a monolithic system, and everyone here uses Mac, so my Windows didn't have much help.
    No exageration that 2 weeks had been spent - I was clear to myself that I'm not here to just debug setting up system and hope magic and chatGPT work. 
    Plus, I was so done telling people in every Stand-up (daily progress check-ups with team) that today I _tried to make
    the Docker works_. Hence, I spoke to the folks and asked for spare Mac the company has. Wallah, I am now working.
    <section>Let's talk main business. I'm ready for the challenge. But where is it?</section>
    Overall, the tasks our team had were on the spectrum of _less important, simple_ and _urgent, difficult_, and I usually would 
    be given the first. Day-to-day, I was given tasks of implementing certain new front-end features from our designer, Lam, she's 
    the goat, or update certain elements. So, I was using <text>React</text> a lot and everyday; mainly in the product 
    <a class="link" href='https://www.aidol.studio/'>Aidol Studio</a>, their video creating software with virtual AI human.
    <br>
    I got to do some backend tasks here and there with database management and interaction in <text>Prisma & GQL</text>. For example,
    I was implementing a mailing feature that would function differently, depending on subscription tier. This required an update
    in db schema. Still though where is the challenge in this internship?
    <section>what I lEaRnEd</section>
    Rather than techinical challenge, I rather had to learn to work in the real office setting, adapt to local Hong Kong colleagues,
    and importantly actively seek to learn new things. I was lucky to be sat with Martin (another goat), who bothered answer me a lot
    of questions about the technology, office, and work life. We've become a pretty good friend, and he told me during that summer,
    it was the most he's ever talked to a colleague. Also, it's really important to not hesitate to seek help, when appropriate,
    dare to come up with your ideas, and not remain content with easy task that you don't learn much from. It's really like
    You get out of it what you put in.
    <br><br>
    I always felt thankful also when the office switched up to English when a few other colleagues or I came into the room. It's
    always of my goals to become fluent in Cantonese, while I'm in Hong Kong. For technical skills, I'd say that besides React and 
    a bit of touch on GQL I really got to
    get my hands very dirty on Git and version control, especially working with an entire team of developers.
    <section>my thoughts on the experience</section>
    Doing a job like this made me realize that working in the business / industry that you enjoy matters. It was interesting to see
    some cool tech stuff like speaking virtual hyper-realistic human - I wish I got some more time to talk with the AI team too.
    Many choices matter and are quite influential. Some people find internship experience life-changing; some learn nothing.
    For me, this experience shapes my path. I believe I could do full-stack development well, and it's an in-demand job. 
    In fact, they were quite satisfied with my output and invited me to join part-time during semester, but I still had too much
    units in school. However,
    I also started to feel I'm capable and suitable for something more ambitious and impactful than web-dev. I'm finidng myself.
    <br><br>
    It was an interesting summer to be doing this internship while trying on some new activities, like I was making a YouTube video
    over 5 weeks (didn't get too many views tho, but I enjoyed it) along with living in kind of the sense that I have total freedom - 
    no school, no parents, no assignments, no group projects.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, I look forward to linking up with some of these colleagues again this year! Thanks for checking the blog!

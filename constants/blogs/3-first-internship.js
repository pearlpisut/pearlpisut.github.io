    Just finished my second year of uni, I was hungry for the internship experience. I only had much to learn
    and time to grow, so I was reaching out to various start-ups I knew from career fairs I went to. 
    <br><br>
    Long story short, I completed a <a href='https://github.com/pearlpisut/pantheon-lab-solution'>programming assignment</a>,
    received, and accepted an offer at Pantheon Lab at Hong Kong Science Park. I was super pumped and would soon be a
    full-stack developer intern - my FIRST _real job_.

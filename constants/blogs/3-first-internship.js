    <br><br>
    Just finished my second year of uni, I was hungry for the internship experience. I only had much to learn
    and so muh competitions for roles, so I was reaching out to various start-ups I knew from career fairs.
    Long story short, I completed a <a class="link" href='https://github.com/pearlpisut/pantheon-lab-solution'>programming assignment</a>,
    received, and accepted an offer at Pantheon Lab at HKSTP - just walkable from my uni. I was super pumped and would soon be a
    full-stack developer intern - my FIRST _real job_.
    <section>the beginner's struggle</section>
    It's a young start-up of around 20 employees, working to deliver software solutions with its unique digital AI-human; for
    example, Kiosk order machine in KFC and info center at airports. I sat in one of the corner, a monitor on
    my table, shy and clueless. It started off with me trying to set up their backend systems in
    Docker. It's a monolithic system, and everyone here uses Mac, so my Windows didn't have much help.
    No exageration that 2 weeks had been spent - I was clear to myself that I'm not here to just debug setting up system and hope magic and chatGPT work. 
    Plus, I was so done telling people in every Stand-up (daily progress check-ups with team) that today I _tried to make
    the Docker works_. Hence, I spoke to the folks and asked for spare Mac the company has. Wallah, I am now working.
    <section>I'm ready for the challenge. But where is it?</section>
    Day-to-day, I was given tasks of implementing certain new front-end features from our designer, Lam, she's the goat, or update
    certain elements. So, I was using <text>React</text> a lot and everyday.

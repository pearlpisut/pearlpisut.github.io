    Does it already sound like fun by the opening? Haha, I'm trying to write. This trip is organized by my college, Morningside,
    to educate students about community service and civic engagement - basically, prepare us to be ready to and equipped with
    skills, mindset, and knowledge needed for solving social issues, as a member of the community.

    I actually really enjoyed my time in this trip. No pressure for taking nice photo, no rush to check out all attractions, no
    need to plan my itinerary. I'm just here to learn and follow the program, which also include some funsies and free time. For 10 days!. 
    That's PERFECT. Ideal trip.
    <section>how's Africa? how's Morocco?</section>
    First, I must say how weird it is to be the only one in the group with a bad passport. Looking around, there are UK, Hong Kong,
    US, Brazilian passports. I was the only one who need Visa for Morocco and Europe (our stop-over). My heartbeat raised every time
    I'm at immigration. Enough said, it took grueling 3 flights, 20 hours for me to get from Bangkok to Rabat, Morocco.
    <br><br>
    Rabat may have one of the best summer weather in the world. Temperature is like 15-25. It is beautiful. We stayed at sort of a boutique hotel, very close
    to the beach (yes, foreshadowing), that is really really beautiful and lively. You could even enjoy surfing there. Morocco is
    a north African and an Arab country, which means people are muslim, pale-skinned, and speak Arabic, Moroccan Darija dialect, and
    also French! The whole place you will notice two main characters of it. Cat and Football.
    <br><br>
    I was thrilled and, the whole 10 days, acting like that kid in class who tried to ask a lot of questions and got everyone's
    lunch time delayed (I'm sorry).

    Just in case (slim chance) that anyone of the team reads, it was a very great team work. It was during the break before my 
    final semester in highschool. I, honestly, felt like too much of an average guy, never an international Olympiad student, never
    participated in big clubs like music band or student union, never have a girlfriend too LOL - basically, I felt
    I have done nothing quite memorable or profound at all. Coupled with that time being application period for international
    universities, I really wanted to _do more_. 
    <section>#how-it-starts</section>
    I was taking Astronomy lessons at school during that break. I knew I could count on my main man, Guy, a friend in the camp
    who also were making applications too. I believe I didn't hesitate at all. Literally like 20 minutes after the idea popped
    up in my head, I perhaps talked to mom and him immediately. HE's IN! Looking back from right now where I'm having bigger,
    riskier entrepreneurial and every dream, I was proud and even impressed by the courage and spontaneity of myself there.
    These days, I'm held back by risk, self-doubt, anticipated criticism to pursue the big dreams I have in my head, though
    some is reasonable, yes. This experience remind my today self that, I've done it, and I surely could and will do it again.
    <br><br>
    The idea that came up to me was we're going to make a custom reusable cloth mask with a cute school logo or mascot on it,
    which there hadn't been one before. Then, we'll donate all the profits to Ramathibodi hospital towards their Covid relief fund.
    It was not too complicated. I got into quick talk with Guy immediately.
    <section>the game plan</section>
    We knew we needed more people. Two main roles we have to fill up. A designer and someone who could talk to the school about
    using the name and logo. We got one friend who loves drawing, and another one who was in student union and dealt with admin
    teachers a lot, who also brought in another friend who were interested in the idea too. So, now off we go.
    <br><br>
    My role was to take care of producing the mask, luckily my mom knows a shop who can do that. The girls, three other folks besides
    me and Guy, were quite close and helped each other in brainsotrming over design, while Guy and I was discussing about the way
    to run this, like where to sell, pricing, when to sell and how to promote.
    <br><br>
    A week went by, we did do things quite efficiently. The design was ready. I had my mom forwarded the producer to make some samples.
    They were great. We're ready. It's TIME TO SELL. We promoted the pre-order in School Facebook group, groupchat, alumni groupchat,
     every friend and teacher that we see. I was selling hard. It's obvious that dealing with something of lower stake (cheaper)
     and very relevant like this made it easier and allowed me to think more spontaneously. Exercising critical thinking and 
    better planning will allow me to take on something of higher stake more smoothly and safely.
    <section>important part - how it goes</section>
    The response was well. You know in highschool, the students' parents do go crazy about these stuff too haha. We got quite some sales
    from parents, then the current students, including ones we pursuaded XD. It was fun to do all of this and be behind a (modestly) 
    big thing that was going on, and especially seeing something you started began to grow. Man, thinking about it, it feels nice.
    <br><br>
    We managed to profit about 14,500THB. Then, five of us put some from our pockets to get it to 15,000THB before contacting the
    hospital about all this.

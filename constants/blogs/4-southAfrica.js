    I think we all have something we are unreasonably excited about. 
    For me, it's <a class="link" href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7741824/'>Boss Baby</a>. For my brother though, it's this very
    country of South Africa. It's winter time in the southern hemisphere, a habitat to penguins, and an open book to a long history
    of the Africas. We were set for a 16-days trip, over three cities of Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Cape Town. That'd be the longest
    vacation in my life, but little did I know what I would experience...

    <br><br>
    A short note: this is the first part of my experience in 5-months exchange semester in Toronto. Many memories and 
    unquantifiable learnings came back with me, and it's more fun to break them down into points that we could talk about more in
    detail.
    <br><br>
    Here, let's talk about Weather and the unseen nature of Canada.
    <br><br>
    I've always been that kid that ask to get the temperature down, to sweat badly, and to get upset amid the heat. 
    I think I can't be blamed there. When it's hot, sweat dripping at your back and forehead, sometimes even at your thighs, and 
    breaths even feel hot coming off your nose. It can't help but be moody. It also isn't quite attractive and comfortable to me, in my opinion, 
    for one to be bothered by the sweat and heat.
    It was always my dream to be in somewhere actually COLD and to see snow for my first time. 
    I surely didn't know what it'd feel like to be in snow, but I just wanted, for now.
    <section>right on the first day</section>
    Excited by how steam comes off my mouth when I speak, I got off the long ride to Toronto. It's my first time in the America,
    and you know you have seen so much about it in movies, sports, and YouTube, but we won't talk about that this blog. I was well
    equipped with winter clothes I never had to use before, prepared by my mom. Under a great impression of TTC (Toronto's public
    transit system), I got home in no time and cheap. The 2 housemates and I went out for a dinner in Korea Town, near our house, and
    it started when we came out. It was SNOWING.
    <br><br>
    My heartbeat raised. It is happening. Small flakes are falling from the sky - into my hand, into my beanie, and everywhere.
    I tried to grab the snow off the grow and make a small snowball. It worked. I've made a snowball before pathetically throwing it.
    To really describe how I reacted to all this, I will mention that I made a video of me running in snow, grabbing it, making some
    footprints on the groud to post on IG and send to my family, who has never seen snow before. Of course, I was met with a reply
    that says like 'pearl, is this your first time seeing snow?' XD. It was all excited until you are dealing with it for the next
    4 months.
    <section>how canadians and I deal with the winter</section>
    Canadians are built different. A short sentence to prefase this section. I like the cold and all, but these people, adults, 
    and nannies, they go for an outdoor run when it was -5'c degree with a beanie, tight legging, sporty shirt, and gloves, possibly
    refueled by Tim Hortans afterwards. I discover that I'm quite fine if my leg is well warmed, then my top I only need a shirt and
    a hoodie, even when it snows. That's a bit weird of me I think. Houses have heater installed, and it's very efficient. It's not
    hot but nice and cozy inside. At classroom, you hang your thick Canada Goose on the chair and hold them around your arm indoors.
    It rarely rains in Jan-Feb, and while snowing, I found only beanie is enough to protect me. I don't quite enjoy neither
    my feet got frozen stepping on snow in sneakers nor wearing thick booth. Yet, everything is well managable, but ... I also BIKED.
    <br><br>
    It took me a few weeks until I finally knew how to equip myself with what will make me survive biking in the real winter and snow.
    The goggles, gloves, and beanie - the usual. Somehow it is managable to bike in such a weather, because your thighs activation really
    helps warm you well. I could kind of better understand why people love the Tim Hortan's. A hot sip of French Vanilla when your face is
    freezing red and hands are numb sound so good, right? So, let's talk about the beautiful part of this, shouldn't we.

    Several other exchange friends and I made it out of the groupchat. We went on a trip to Banff, Alberta. It was unreal the mountain
    landscape we saw while driving. We saw glaciers, frozen waterfall, endless mountain lines, peaks totally covered in snow.
    It was an amazing time - not too cold, good company. I could understand and enjoy myself the lifestyle of having cold adventure
    before coming back to the hot tub and cozy cooking session at home. The highlight also is winter sport. I really love skiing.
    It is so much thrill and adrenaline. It involves danger, fun, and techniques. On my second ever time to ski here, I decided
    to have a bit more fun. I ski'd down the whole ski mountain, to get back to buses. There were many times I almost fell of the
    edge of the mountain, and friends were concerned for me haha. But, I MADE IT. And. I would love to ski again very much.

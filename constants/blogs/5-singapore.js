    It's now July. The summer has well started. I just came back from a (long) trip in South Africa, a semester in Canada, 
    and a school work in Morocco. I couldn't be more happy to be back home. It was honestly upset to me to have to go to Singapore
    again, though for a good reason - my very brother's graduation.
    <section>My original thought</section>
    Away from home again, 9 days, and family trip (implied intense schedule) don't sound like a nice idea. And honestly I didn't
    look forward to anything in Singapore. Pictures in my head were it's tiny and boring. Coupled with having to navigate my family
    around all days, it just felt like I'd be wasting 9 days of my life. Okay, but enough with rambling, it's quite clear
    I was no interested. But I was rather again wrong to myself.
    <section>Small city: the size to my liking?</section>
    Since my time in Toronto and Hong Kong, I'm starting to realize I quite enjoy being in small city. It's convenient to go anywhere
    - the buses, trains, trams - where I was even biking, a lot, in Toronto. Meeting up with friends, going to a beach, and trying
    new restaurants are real easy. I feel more connected and comfortable over the area than being a small dot of a vast city, like
    Bangkok, where I gotta get to places by car.
    <br><br>
    Singapore is well accessible by bus and metro train with comprehensive routes, frequency, and punctualty (omg I'm truly 
    impressed) - especially with how accurate you can track the bus through Google Map. It's funny to think about it though that 
    sometimes when you search for restaurants on Google Map, you end up looking over the entire country.
    <section>what is Singapore native?</section>
    One thing I look to explore in each country is their unique cultures and languages. I long believe that every country must
    have something that distinct or unique to it. So, it was hard for me to get used to Toronto, where many immigrants, language, 
    and cultures share the same ground, very harmoniously and interestingly. Especially when I meet with Chinese-Canadians who
    were totally raised in Canada, do not speak Putonghua, and resonate more with western cultures.
    <br><br>
    What about Singapore? The accent already got me hahaha. I really love it, in fact, I try practicing sometimes. But seriously,
    it was confusing to me at first. But now, I get it that we have Singaporean Chinese, Malay, and Indian that make up the country.
    And for this, there are China Town, Arab street, and Mi goreng in here. Sings here are in 4 languages, hahaha.
    Thanks to this, I REALLY enjoyed the foodie life here.
    It's very easy to get Mala, Nasi goreng, Butter chicken, and even Thai food, plus it is even cheaper than Hong Kong somehow!
    Around each train station or literally almost everywhere, there are food centers on the side of the roads - some famous ones are like
    Chomp Chomp and Newton. Food is good, getting around is good; now let me talk about a little other things.
    <section>the bonus about singapore</section>
    Let's keep it short. First, organized and clean. Things are well-designed and taken care of, such as housing plan, traffic signs,
    and pavements. Second, super safe. It is probably the safest city in the world, and I guess I don't need to add much to it.
    It's not that the rule is very strict that everyone seems fearful, but it generally makes me feel there is no threat at all
    walking past the people and streets. They all look like a regular working, law-abiding people, who are up to something.
    <br><br>
    Plus, it's quite easy to communicate in English, and people seem to have good hospitality. I got to meet up with some friends
    and family's friends, and it's been pretty wholesome. Singapore is also a hub to many travel spots, like Johor Bahru, Bintan,
    Batam, Bangkok (yes, my home), Bali, and etc. I quite get it now that why some westerners relocated to here.
    <section>being there for family</section>
    And yes the most important part, and why I come to Singapore. Whether I like it or not, I think to myself I CANNOT be absent
    to these important dates of my brother, even though we fight and may not get along the best. Not only that, but it's about my
    parents too, who otherwise would be alone and worried about me at home. Supporting each other , by as easily as showing up, 
    to me is non-neglegible. Especially considering how much I have been supported by my family. In short, I'm glad and proud 
    to be in Singapore with my family on these celebrations.
    <br><br>
    Overall, Singapore has now quite moved up on my ranking. My main goal of this blog is to share the joy I have from visiting here haha.
    I enjoyed the experience, especially when I had expected not to, and
    I'd love to come visit again!
